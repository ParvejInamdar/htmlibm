            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br><br>
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring<br>
                special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic <br>
                respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br><br>
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it <br>
                spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching <br>
                your face. <br><br>
                The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or <br>
                sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br><br>
                At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating <br>
                potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>
